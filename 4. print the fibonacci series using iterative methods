# iterative method is the method of continuously or repetition of same block of code over and over to find the related output.


code :

def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    # Initialize variables to store the first two Fibonacci numbers
    fib_list = [0, 1]

    # Iterate from 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous two
        next_fib = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]
        # Append the next Fibonacci number to the list
        fib_list.append(next_fib)

    # Print the Fibonacci series
    for fib in fib_list:
        print(fib, end=" ")

# Example usage:
n = 10  # Number of Fibonacci numbers to print
fibonacci_iterative(n)
